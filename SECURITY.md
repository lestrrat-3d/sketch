# Security Policy

## Scope

sketch is a headless parametric 2D sketch engine. Because it is designed to
consume sketch/world documents and parameter expressions that may be authored by
an automated agent, the primary security concern is **crafted input** — a
malformed or hostile JSON document, parameter expression, or spline/NURBS
definition that reaches the public API and causes a denial of service (unbounded
CPU or memory, a hang) or a reachable panic. Bugs of that kind are in scope.
Issues that only affect test code, examples, or internal tooling are welcome as
ordinary bug reports rather than security reports.

## Supported Versions

No release is tagged yet; until one is, `main` is the reference and only line
that receives fixes. Once `v0.x.x` releases exist, the most recent minor will
receive security updates.

| Version  | Supported                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| v0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: (pre-1.0) |
| < v0.1.0 | :x: (unreleased)             |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, please report it via [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/lestrrat-3d/sketch/security/advisories/new).
Please include explicit steps to reproduce the security issue — a minimal
reproducer or failing test, and the commit SHA you tested against, are ideal.

We will do our best to respond in a timely manner, but please also be aware that
this project is maintained by a very limited number of people. Please help us
with test code and such.
